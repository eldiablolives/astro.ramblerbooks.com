              A rich man offers Liam money to use his talents to train a sex slave for him, and everyone has a price.
              The problem is, what happens when you accept? Be careful whom you lay in bed with, or you might lose
              everything.
            </p>

            <p>
              Liam is faced with a dilemma. He needs the money to finance his lifestyle, but he worries about making a
              mistake. Once dealing with the rich and connected, you must learn how to play a different game.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is the story in the same universe as Behind the Glass Door. It follows Liamâ€™s exploits as he turns
              his slave-training knowledge into a profitable business.
