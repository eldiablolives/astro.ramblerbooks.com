              is in love with his forest, and his people are one with nature. They would never allow the werewolves to
              hide there. The forest rejected them. The clash between the two tribes becomes inevitable, the werewolves
              and something else. As the two groups lay claim to one land, Rom wonders if he could survive. One man
              against the werewolves. Undoubtedly he must lose.
