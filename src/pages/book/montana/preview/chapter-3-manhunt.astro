              As soon as Moni sat in her plane seat, a terrible sense of foreboding came over her. She tried to use her
              phone, but the cabin crew reminded her to keep it off. Moni&#39;s feeling of unease grew on her flight to
              Seattle. It appeared to her that the close she gets to her destination, the worse she felt. Moni spent the
              last thirty minutes tapping her foot, waiting for the plane to land. As soon as the wheels touched the
              ground, Moni switched on her phone, getting a lovely message Sally sent her. This didn’t ease her mind.
              She called Sally walking towards the exit; the phone kept ringing without an answer.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pete waited for Moni at the exit barrier, waving to her as soon as he spotted her. She ran up to him,
              giving him a hug then Pete led her out to the car. They lived on the outskirts, not too far from the
              airport, so it took less than an hour to get home. Pete wanted to chat with Moni, but seeing her concerned
              face and tapping foot, he drove in silence. Twice he saw her make a call and hang up frustrated.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moni’s mom welcomed her home with open arms; she practically dragged her inside, offering her tea and
              cookies. Moni looked around; her home looked exactly the way she left it. Crosses and little icons of
              Jesus on every wall. If there were vampires, this was a home they’d never come to. This constant religious
              oppression was one of the main reasons she couldn’t wait to turn eighteen and leave her home. It felt like
              living in some cave with primitive people who believed in ghosts and spirits and shit. It was the main
              reason why Moni never had any friends. Everyone knew her family were religious nuts and teased her; nobody
              wanted to be seen with her, lest they be painted by the same brush. This ultra-conservative setting
              contributed to her staying a virgin for so long. The kids knew Moni’s stepdad. He was a great hunter and a
              mean drunk. People used to joke how Pete’s got more ammunition at home than a military base. In a sense,
              it was true since bullets were expensive, so Pete made his own.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was late, and Moni wasn’t in the mood for talking. She excused herself, claiming tiredness and went
              into her old room. She sent many texts and made calls with no responses. She felt it deep in her gut;
              something was very wrong. If she was a different person, Moni might imagine that Sally ghosted her for
              some reason. Still, Moni knew how her fiancee felt. Both girls loved each other like crazy. It would be
              inconceivable for either of them to break up that way, especially as their relationship was getting even
              better with Moni being accepted by Sally’s family. Something terrible must have happened.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moni couldn’t fall asleep the whole night, something that showed at breakfast in the morning. Her parents
              worriedly asked her what’s wrong and she promised to tell them in the evening. Moni loved her parents. She
              disagreed with their life choices and despised the religious dogma and pressure they exerted on her.
              Still, they were kind and loving people who didn’t know any better. Moni ate her breakfast in misery, a
              couple of tears rolled down, but she discretely wiped them off before her parents noticed. They saw her do
              it and just kept quiet, greatly unsettled by it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moni spent a day calling all her friends, asking if they saw Sally, nobody did. By the time her parents
              came home, she was almost hysterical. Moni knew deep down in her heart that something terrible happened to
              Sally. Her mom heard her screams and gently came upstairs, knocking on the open door “please, honey, come
              down, talk to us, we can pray together, it will help”. At first, Moni wanted to explode, take everything
              out on her mother, but something broke inside her, and she flew in her mom’s arms, sobbing like a baby.
              The years of mental conditioning steering her in a moment of despair.
            </p>

            <p>
              The family sat in the living room, praying for protection and assistance. In tears, Moni begged god to
              look after Sally, help her and guide her, protect her from harm. Her mom and dad watched her surprised;
              they never saw Moni pray so hard, with such humility in earnest. Mom later made some tea and cookies,
              sitting everyone at the table and asked, “who is Sally?”. Moni was mentally exhausted. She had no energy
              left for tactfulness. She just blurted it out, “Sally is my soulmate, my girlfriend, my fiancee; I came
              here to tell you I am getting married to her”; then she burst into tears.
            </p>

            <p>
              The shock of the revelation rippled through Moni’s parents, then another one once they processed what she
              was saying. Their immediate reaction was a rejection of the idea, followed by self-righteous condemnation,
              threats of hellfire and scorn. Still, as they saw their desperate daughter in anguish, all was forgotten,
              replaced by love and genuine concern. They never saw Moni in so much pain; all they want to do was protect
              their little baby.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moni planned to spend a week with her parents, but after Sally’s phone ran out of battery, Moni freaked
              out completely, returning on the third day. She spent the whole flight tapping her foot, palms sweaty
              despite taking her mom’s prescription Xanax to calm down. She practically ran out of the airport,
              wrestling a cab from some guy in a suit and told the driver to step on it.
            </p>

            <p>
              She burst into her home, running everywhere to check if maybe Sally was sick. Everything was exactly as
              she left it. Both girls were very pedantic, borderline compulsive. Coming to the living room, she saw
              Sally’s phone on a coffee table with her jewellery but not her engagement ring. Moni took a few deep
              breaths, forcing the calmness just like she learned in her yoga class. She methodically went from room to
              room, paying attention to the tiniest details, looking for any clues. Quickly she saw Sally’s tracksuit
              missing, the trainers were gone too, so she must have changed at some point after coming home. She looked
              in the hamper, finding the clothes Sally wore the last time she saw her, including her underwear. “Why
              would you change underwear before going out for a run?” Missing her scent, she pulled her clothes and
              sniffed them, feeling somehow closer to her loved one
            </p>

            <p>
              “wait! What was that?” Moni sniffed Sally’s clothes again, this time carefully; they smelled like piss.
              “Why would you pee yourself?” Dried piss could be smelled all the way down the legs of her jeans. She even
              took a taste to make sure of it. “Who pees themselves and by this much, and more importantly, why?” She
              dug in the hamper finding a purple towel smelling of piss. It was used to wipe it off something. She
              carefully looked at everything then went inch by inch over the floor until she found uneven smudges of
              hastily cleaning some liquid. Moni smelled the floor, detecting the faint scent of urine and looking up,
              noticed a few scratches on the wall right next to it. One had a red tint, just like the nail polish Sally
              wore.
            </p>

            <p>
              It all came to Moni at once. Someone was here when Sally got back. Someone attacked her, held her against
              the wall, she peed herself in fear, then she was taken, all evidence removed. In sheer panic, Moni ran to
              the living room and called the police.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dressed in a black leather motorcycle suit, I carried a massive black duffel bag down the street wearing a
              full-face tinted helmet. I walked up to a black Toyota Camry that I stole earlier that day from a nearby
              family that I watched through my telescope for some time. It was the most popular brand and colour of a
              car in California. The owners went on holiday a couple of days back. Nobody will notice the missing car
              till they came back. I opened the trunk, placed the duffel bag inside, unzipping it a little to facilitate
              airflow. Two pale-blue frightened eyes watched me slam the trunk door, locking her in.
            </p>

            <p>
              I sat in the car and drove for a couple of miles before removing my helmet. It took a while to get out of
              the town, fighting the LA traffic but soon, it all quieted. I pulled on the far end of the freeway rest
              stop, parking on the most distant truck stop, next to my Hummer and the massive custom metal trailer. I
              opened the trunk and transferred the duffel bag, putting it on the back seat next to the pillow I placed
              there, unzipping it and covering Sally with a blanket. I sat in the driver’s seat and slowly took off. I
              headed straight for Las Vegas, intending to reach Utah before sunrise. I could drive to Idaho during the
              day without worrying too much about the police disturbing me.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite fiction and heroic movies, the reality was that most kidnappings are never solved, and those that
              were, are usually overwhelming in clues often related to freak accidents like being searched by a cop when
              transporting the victim. Once the victim reaches the final destination, it is usually too late. I was
              methodical and careful. I knew I couldn’t prevent a random stroller or a nosy neighbour from seeing a
              strange guy carrying a big bag. Once the alarm is raised, it all becomes the race for time. I figured I’ve
              got at least two days of a head start. Barring the situation outside my control, it was already too late
              for Sally.
            </p>

            <p>
              It took her a couple of hours to get out of the bag. At first, she lay there petrified, her panic
              increasing. In her imagination, all the terrible thing that will happen to her multiplied and grew. She
              cried herself into a hazed state. All the fight left her; only desperation stayed. She felt the car&#39;s
              steady movement, the constant hum of engines, and decreasing traffic volume, knowing with each mile she is
              just that further from any help. She felt she should scream and fight, do something. Instead, her body
              stayed frozen, her mind accepting her faith.
            </p>

            <p>
              The dawn found us in Utah. We had another twenty minutes to go before I turned onto a dirt road towards an
              abandoned farm I found on google maps. I pulled in, drove for a while, then stopped in the middle of the
              arid, dusty field. The hilly terrain hid us from the road. There was nobody around for as far as the eye
              can see. The girl sat on the back seat, frozen in fear, unable to move. Reaching inside, I grabbed a
              fistful of her thick dirty-blonde hair, yanking her out of the car, onto the dirt. She cried and trembled,
              not knowing what’s going to happen next.
            </p>

            <p>
              I turned to her, slowly unzipped my pants, pulling out my cock. She tried to pull back, squealing in
              desperation and terror. I just turned my back to her and pissed into the dust. Shaking off, zipping up, I
              turned to Sally and looked at her. She still lay curled up in the dirt, so I pulled her up by her hair, my
              other hand pulling down her pants, then I forced her in a squat position. I didn’t have to explain; she
              immediately let it go and peed. When she was done, I forced her back up, leaning her against the car,
              pulling up her pants. I stuffed two Xanax pills into her mouth, gave her a cup of water and made her
              drink, then forced my fingers into her mouth, checking if she swallowed it tall.
            </p>

            <p>
              The girl had no idea what I gave her. Whatever it was, she had no control over it anyway. One of the pills
              would be enough to keep her calm. Two was a slight overdose. I figured it would keep a featherweight like
              her nice and docile for the rest of the day when more cars are on the road and more chances of unplanned
              encounters. Back on the road, the girl curled herself into a corner, wrapped in a blanket, shivering from
              sheer emotional stress. Too much adrenaline pumped through her body, her flight response curbed by immense
              fear. I set my back mirror to watch her; she slowly calmed down and drifted off to sleep. I took a swig of
              strong coffee from the thermos, focusing on the long road ahead. I used our pitstop to refuel the Hummer.
              I packed the back with metal canisters full of gasoline, having no intention of stopping at the gas
              station as it was a significant risk.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first out of four planned refuel stops went without problems. In my estimation, we should reach home
              late that night. I relaxed comfortably in my seat, set the cruise control to speed limit and drove. The
              girl was out of it. The drugs combined with mental exhaustion knocked her out, just as I hoped it would. I
              wasn’t planning on getting her any more liquid till sundown. I didn’t want to add the risk of pee-stops to
              my journey. I kept an empty plastic bottle on the seat next to me if I had to go.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hummer ate miles, working perfectly. I made sure to service it just before my trip. The trailer behind me
              was massive. It looked like I was pulling a greyhound bus, an easy job for Hummer’s ten-litre engine. It
              was essential to pack everything I needed in one go. I loaded the trailer to the max with all the tools
              and building materials I would need. The whole house was neatly flat-packed inside. It made me think about
              how my entire life fit in one car and a trailer.
            </p>

            <p>
              I chewed on a sandwich, washing it down with coffee. This was to be the last food before I reached my
              destination. The sun was high in the sky; the girl slept snuggled at the back, occasionally kicking with
              her limbs. Whatever she dreamed about wasn’t good. Given her current predicament, I couldn’t blame her. I
              was happy she was asleep; it made my life easier. I didn’t bring any food for her and didn’t intend to
              feed her until we arrived. Hungry people are easier to control. They focus on the hopelessness of their
              situation rather than opportunities to change it. This is something I learned in the middle east, watching
              hungry kids running around with guns and bombs; cannon fodder for the ones sending them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Back in Afghanistan, I saw the way the Taliban handled their women. Take care of them, give them freedom
              but keep them on a short leash, so they don’t forget their role in life. We had it good in America, too
              many liberties and people talking about shit they knew nothing about. It sure is proper for men and women
              to have equal rights; it would be a fool who disagreed. Women have earned that right many times over, but
              what those retarded aggressive loudmouth cunts have done with it was an insult to everything women like my
              female fellow soldiers bled to achieve. That sleeping sexy feminist lesbian blonde in the back of the car
              was up for a rude awakening and a valuable life lesson, the Taliban way.
            </p>

            <p>
              I used to have a friend stationed with me in Iraq. Tony was the toughest girl around; she could drink,
              fight and fuck better than any man I knew. She had my back, and I had hers. Tony used to rant about the
              feminists all the time. She called them privileged cunts who never had to do anything real in their lives,
              just bitch about the things they don’t like. I used to laugh at her and tease her about it. She always
              claimed that she was the real feminist, doing the hard thing like any man, showing the girls how it was
              done. Tony never minced her words, and I loved her for it. We’d get together in secret every chance we got
              and fuck like there was no tomorrow. I wanted to marry her when we got out of the sandpit, and she said
              yes. It turns out there wasn’t tomorrow after all. The brass found out and split us up. Two weeks later, I
              found her raped and tortured, impaled on a street sign in some fucked up ruin of a town.
            </p>

            <p>
              I wasn’t on the roof anymore to have her back. The fucking cunts got her. Fucking spotter was too busy
              jacking off with his phone or something instead of looking out for my love. I smashed his face when I saw
              him earning me a week in the hole. They chucked him out on dishonourable discharge, releasing me free as a
              bird. Someone gotta kill all those terrorists, after all. When I got out, I found the asshole in Baltimore
              arranged a little accident for him before I got home. It didn’t make me feel better, but that one wasn’t
              for me. It was for Tony. She’d herself if she was alive.
            </p>

            <p>
              Both Starla and Sally reminded me of Tony. They had the same body type. I asked her once, “why does such a
              beautiful girl end up here” she looked at me seriously and said, “because someone has to show the others
              that we can”. She always was straight to point, no bullshit, no chitchat, no fluff. I imagined our kids
              with strong minds and bodies; nothing less could come out of her.
            </p>

            <p>
              I heard a siren in the distance. I quickly sat up, checked my speed, removed my two guns&#39; safety, and
              then watched them in the mirror and as they passed by. Still not out of the woods, I looked at the maps
              for county borders. There might be a roadblock ahead. On high alert, I dove over the line, nobody there,
              nothing in sight. One after another, I stretched my muscles, drank some cold coffee and drove ahead.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Dean”, said detective Baylor, extending his hand. Moni shook it, noticing the firm handshake and sat
              down. “I know you’ve already said it several times, but please take me through the events step by step,
              and please include anything else you feel might be relevant”. Something told Moni Dean could be trusted.
              He was a tall man in his early forties with curious blue eyes that wouldn’t stay still. His demeanour was
              confident and calm, his voice soothing. There was a deep dark shadow on his face and an unusual timbre in
              the tone of his voice, making him come across as mysterious. Intuitively Moni sensed that there was some
              sort of horrible tragedy in his life, something she could connect to on a primal level. Through sobs and
              tears, Moni told him everything. She repeated herself many times. The detective listened attentively,
              never asking questions, never interrupting, never hurrying her along. He let her tell her story at her own
              pace, watching carefully her body language, breathing, reactions, studying her in detail like his
              psychiatrist friend Cyrus taught him.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean let Moni cry after she finished, using that time to write down some notes. Then he sat and thought,
              replayed everything back in his head. Unlike other policemen, he asked Moni to show him Sally’s clothes.
              They were packed in evidence bags. He went to the kitchen, found a pot of Nescafe, and took a few deep
              whiffs, then pushed his nose into the bag and took a deep breath. Immediately he detected a faint odour of
              urine. He sealed the bag and stood in the centre of the living room, looking around, absorbing every
              detail. Closing his eyes, he imagined multiple possibilities. With his eyes clothes, he walked towards the
              bathroom and stopped. “Is this where you saw the markings?” He asked Moni, and she confirmed.
            </p>

              He took out his cellphone, turned on the camera, increasing magnification. For the next half an hour, he
              painstakingly examined every inch of the wall, every irregularity, every scratch. Standing in front of the
              wall, he lifted his arm, pointing it up and down, measuring the angle, then wrote something into his
              notebook. Finally, he sat down again with Moni. “I believe your intuition is right. There are some
              indications that she was taken against her will, but there is no strong evidence. There are many plausible
              explanations more believable than kidnapping”. Moni started to cry, nodding in understanding. “I will look
              for the evidence to support your story, but so far, there has been no communication, nobody saw her and no
              ransom demands. It has been three days since you last saw her. Based on what you told me about her, the
              only probability fitting that version of the events would be that she has been taken by a psychopath”.
              Mony covered her mouth and wept. Her whole world was crashing down. “In case this is true, the chance of
              her being found or saved is next to zero. You need to prepare yourself for the worst news. As long as
              there is no news, it is good news, and we’ll keep digging. We’ll keep looking, I promise you that. I will
              not stop”. Moni looked into Dean’s eyes. There was something else there, a cold steel determination and
              perhaps pain.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean did the last sweep around the house, looking through the windows, then got out of the house and
              walked up and down the street, memorizing everything. He noticed broken street lamps several streets away.
              This did look suspicious. Assuming that, indeed, it was a kidnapping, the precision and brazen audacity of
              the act would suggest someone who knew Sally well and knew her movements. The problem was, she was quite a
              vocal public figure. There was no shortage of lunatics to pick her out. The problem was, judging by the
              way it was done, there wasn’t any evidence, and there likely never will be; this crime was just too clean.
              It was three days since Sally disappeared; deep down inside, he knew she was gone.
            </p>

            <p>
              I stopped in a deserted truck stop, hidden from the view of the road. The sun was still high up in the
              sky. I jumped out of the car, stretched for a few minutes and refuelled. I looked closely through the
              tinted window and couldn’t see the girl, which was good. She was still sleeping; the Xanax I gave her
              knocked her out good. Not wishing to waste time, I started the car and got back on the road. I was more
              than two-thirds of the way there, still in Wyoming. Only a few more hours before I crossed into Montana.
            </p>

            <p>
              A car pulled up in front of Sally’s home, three girls ran up, hugging the distraught Moni, all of them in
              tears. Moni called her friends immediately after calling the police, asking them if they saw Sally,
              telling them what happened. The girls wanted to help, burning up ether, asking for help on social media,
              calling their friends. Within just a few hours, a large group of women, many of whom knew Sally and Moni
              in person, were incensed. One of their own has been taken; it was unacceptable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Late in the day, one of Moni’s friends went to the airport and brought back Sally’s parents, who couldn’t
              just stay home and wait to see what happened. They had to be there and help somehow, so they booked the
              first flight out of New York; their only baby was taken. Moni ran into their arms as they entered the
              apartment. She felt somehow connected to Sally’s parents, the only people who loved her as much ash she
              did, and she cried.
            </p>

            <p>
              By the following day, the whole feminist lobby was up in arms. They called people, bombarded social media.
              They were very pissed off. Around eight in the morning, the first news van showed up in front of Moni’s
              house, others following shortly. Sally’s dad Mike was a spokesperson with his wife and future daughter in
              law clinging to his arms teary-eyed. He made a brief statement, then answered questions. Unknown to him,
              another bunch of news vans surrounded a police station wanted an explanation. What was done to find Sally?
              Is there a serial killer in town? Should people be worried, lock up their daughters? They asked all sorts
              of questions, intelligent and otherwise, the commissioner patiently answering what he could.
            </p>

            <p>
              The news about Sally’s kidnapping exploded all over the evening news. Citizens were asked to come forward
              if they saw something. The narrative quickly turned to Sally’s work. People speculated that it was one of
              those crazy men organizations who disliked the feminist movement, promoting hate speech, women abuse, and
              championing toxic masculinity behind the kidnapping.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the week, the narrative took a complete left turn. It wasn’t about poor Sally anymore but about the
              dangers of men. The feminists capitalizing on free exposure to get their message across. They quickly
              organized a protest calling it “a march for Sally”. Thousands of girls took to the streets with “stop the
              rape” placards. Prominent feminist figures, Sally’s peers used her misfortune to gain a leg up in the
              community. They were competing with each other for the leadership position. It helped with book sales and
              talking tours.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moni’s mom took a leave of absence from her work and flew to Los Angeles, where she met Sally’s parents.
              Two very different families united in grief over the daughters who loved each other. Mike had to go back
              to New York, and the two mothers stayed with Moni, who was barely able to function. She ate little, slept
              less. Moni would wake up with tears in her eyes and fell asleep crying. Every waking moment she would
              spend calling around, offering her help, anything to find Sally. She clearly couldn’t function alone, so
              the mothers took care of her, forcing her to eat and sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally stirred on the back seat, stretching, feeling the warm blanket. For the moment, she forgot where she
              was before it hit her. Her eyes flew open, looking around. She was in the car with that man who kidnapped
              her. It was getting dark outside, which meant she spent the whole day sleeping, immediately realizing what
              those two pills were. There was more chance someone would see her during the day, so the man drugged her,
              and now they were god-knows-where. Curling up to a fetal seating position, Sally sat in the corner looking
              through the window. The terrain looked different from what she was used to. The man clearly drove for the
              night and the day. Looking at the car’s dashboard over the man’s shoulder, she did quick maths, realizing
              they were far, very far from home by now.
            </p>

            <p>
              Still, under the influence of Xanax, she felt less panicky than before and started to think. The man was
              strong, capable, well organized and methodical. Everything he did had some purpose. He didn&#39;t talk
              with her, didn’t try to scare her or threaten her anymore, feeling no need to reinforce his absolute
              control and dominance. This frightened her more than any violence could; crazy violent people tend to make
              mistakes; this man didn’t. Typical violent men are huge egotists; it was all about them. They can’t stop
              talking about themselves. “What was it that the man said? No more talking.” Sally remembered clearly the
              last words the man spoke to her. He clearly was a man of action. He used his words with a purpose, not
              just to avoid awkward silence.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally played back her capture over and over again, everything she noticed, every sound and smell. She
              didn’t put up any resistance, just followed his lead. He didn’t even really threaten her that much or
              force her into submission. He gave her a choice; her life or Moni’s, and she believed him. “My dearest
              Moni, she’ll never see me again”, Sally thought to herself, feeling tears bubbling in her eyes. She
              pinched herself and took a few slow deep breaths to control her emotions “losing it won’t help me now”.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man drove his car in silence as Sally looked through the window at the darkness, settling over the
              land. It’s been a while since she saw another vehicle. She had no clue where she was, just that it was far
              and, judging by the types of the trees, somewhere north. Sally remembered asking the man what he wanted
              and his response. It was a silly question. She knew what he wanted from the moment he grabbed her, and
              duress or not, she made a conscious choice. In the moment of great stress, she chose to sacrifice herself
              instead of a loved one. “Of course, the man said he would kill me if I chose Moni but, honest to god, I
              wanted to save her”. Sally kept thinking, grasping at anything but reality, feeling good for sacrificing
              herself instead of someone she loved. At that very moment, she knew how much she loved Moni.
            </p>

            <p>
              A steady hum of the engine continued into the night, terrain turning into a deep forest. Sally watched it
              change, feeling empty inside. She knew her final destination would be somewhere behind those woods. There
              she’ll spend the rest of her short life until the man got bored of her, becoming her kidnaper, rapist and
              murderer, burying her in some unmarked grave. A solitary tear ran down her cheek. Inside her heart, she
              sent all her love to Moni, her mother and father, saying a silent prayer, a final goodbye.

              Dean expected a building manager to meet him in the lobby. Instead, the assistant superintendent showed up
              explaining how the building manager recently quit due to a family emergency and moved out of state.
              Writing down his details, he asked to be shown the roof. Taking a good look, Dean thanked the assistant,
              asking to be left alone, after which he carefully walked to the edge. In the distance, he could clearly
              see Sally’s building. He took out his phone to examine the floor using the exact meticulous nature he used
              before. There wasn’t a single scratch, cigarette bud or drop that would suggest someone was here. Taking a
              broader view, he saw that the dust and dirt have been disturbed in one spot. Kneeling there, he examined
              the area for a long time when he found one small brown spot. Someone cleaned this area to place something
              requiring a firm grip of the ground, like a tripod, then sat and waited, drinking coffee.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean took out a small evidence bag and dug out the brown spot using a pocket knife. He would take it to
              the police lab to confirm it was coffee, but it was all a far fetched theory. Sally was an adult. She
              could have escaped a suffocating relationship or went for a holiday, or millions of other things could
              have happened before it became a kidnapping. All the media pressure trickled down through the police
              command structure. His bosses pressuring him to close the case, “close it to what?” he asked them. There
              were no leads, no evidence. He could just drop it on a pile of other unsolved missing cases and set fire
              to them as that&#39;s what good it was for.
            </p>

            <p>
              Los Angeles was a busy town, busy for the police, busy for the criminals; it was a volume business. For
              some reason, and he knew why he cared about this so much. His own daughter was taken this way. He found
              her in the end, regretting that he did. This is why he transferred to LA. He couldn’t stay in Detroit
              anymore.
            </p>

            <p>
              Moni noticed Dean leaning on his parked car the next day. She waved to him to get in; he waved back as if
              to say “later”. He’s been walking up and down for an hour, trying to figure out how it all went. Yesterday
              he gave the piece of the roof to the lab, asking them to confirm whether it was coffee before sitting at
              his desk. The report said none of the critical cameras on the street were working; all were damaged. Dean
              sent the team to knock on doors asking people if they would allow them to take their broken cameras into
              the police lab to figure out what happened. Meanwhile, he just stood there trying to fit all he knew about
              the kidnapping into a single narrative.
            </p>

            <p>
              Assuming all that Dean knew was correct, it all pointed at someone tall, strong and highly skilled at
              gaining access to places unnoticed. Someone who can pick locks and threaten people to give him long term
              access to the rooftop of a large commercial building. So much made sense, but there were big holes in the
              story. “How did he know Monique was leaving the city? How did he know to time it?” Dean mumbled. The
              obvious answer was that he hacked into the girl’s computer or phones. He had techies check everything.
              Nothing was hacked; the alternative was that he had spying equipment. Dean had that examined as well, and
              nothing was found; plus, it raised a question of how would he bring it in and when. “Why not incapacitate
              one girl? Why wait?” He agonized, sure he was missing something important, determined to find out what.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Here you go, inspector”, said Moni’s mom as she poured him a fresh cup of coffee. “Unfortunately, we have
              no news. The team is working hard, but so far, we’ve come up empty-handed”. Moni just sat on the sofa,
              staring at the wall, listening to Dean’s report. She felt empty inside, too much bad news, too many
              failures lately; she clung to hope desperately.
            </p>

            <p>
              The car started to slow down; noticing the change in engine sound and speed, Sally sat up on the back
              seat, watching through the windows. The road snaked through the thick forest, with only the car&#39;s high
              beams and moonlight illuminating the way. All the effects of calming drugs evaporated a while ago. At one
              moment, the car came to a stop and slowly swerved into the opposite lane, then in a wide arch, slowly,
              turned into a narrow opening between the trees. Sally had a good look. This wasn’t a dirt road or a path,
              just some grass and bushes between the trees; the man took the car into the forest.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally held on hard as the car started to bounce and sway, stop and start again, the engine struggling with
              a load of the heavy trailer moving off the road into raw land. The engine growled and tugged until a loud
              clanking sound was heard, and both car and its trailer disappeared inside the forest. The man skilfully
              navigated zigzagging clearing, sometimes driving over fallen branches, carefully avoiding uneven parts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally watched everything mesmerized, like in some bizarre film. After some twenty minutes of that, her
              panic started to rise. She realized the man wasn’t just stopping for a pee-break. They started the final
              portion of their journey, which meant whatever was going to happen, it was going to be soon.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some forty minutes after entering the forest, the truck pushed through to the other side. Sally was
              greeted by a broad vista, an endless prairie, a vast nothingness with just tall grass. The man drove for
              ten more minutes, looking at the compass attached to the dashboard. It was clear to Sally, there were no
              maps to where he was taking her. She felt tears well in her eyes again. She was just so scared of
              everything.
            </p>

            <p>
              At one moment, the car just stopped in the middle of the field. The man left the lights on, slowly getting
              out of the car and stretched before reaching into the back seat, grabbing the girl by her hair and pulling
              her out. She stood wordless next to the man while he closed the car door. Turning to Sally, he unzipped
              her tracksuit jacket, pulling it off. In one swift motion, he removed her bottoms, and running shoes,
              leaving her standing there barefoot and completely naked in the tall grass. “He will rape me now”, thought
              Sally starting to sob uncontrollably. She was scared out of her mind, but the man just turned his back to
              her, threw her clothes into a bag at the back of the car, pulling out a canister to refuel, not paying any
              attention to the girl.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first thought that popped into Sally’s mind was to run as fast as she could, immediately realizing why
              the man took off her clothes and shoes. She couldn’t run anywhere. Her soft, gentle feet weren’t used to
              walking barefoot on any terrain, even standing on the ground felt uncomfortable. Tentatively she made a
              few steps deeper into the grass, then squatted and peed. “I could hide like this. He can’t see me”, she
              thought, unable to force herself to stand up again. Freedom was so close. All she had to do is sneak away
              and hide, the man wouldn’t be able to find her, then somehow she will escape.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man packed up the canisters, pulled out his cock and peed into the grass, then opened the back door of
              the car and like by some magic, Sally felt compelled to get up and meekly walk back inside. She felt her
              heart beating so fast that her breathing was erratic, everything told her to run, escape, and put up some
              resistance, but none of that happened. She sat in her spot; the blanket was gone, there was nothing to
              protect her modesty anymore. It was just her bare skin against the leather seats. If one could call it
              that, the only piece of clothing left on her was the fine metal mesh collar around her neck, looking more
              like a fashionable choker than something a dog would wear. It felt like those delicate metal mesh watch
              straps on expensive wristwatches. On the front of it was a small yet distinct nub with a small ring.
              Sally’s hands scrutinized it. There was some sort of a mechanism to remove the collar, not a simple catch
              or a padlock but something that couldn’t easily be removed by hands.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man drove slowly, always forward, always in a straight line, further and deeper into the nothingness,
              no trees, no hills, no lights, just endless grass. The car growled, the engine fighting uneven terrain,
              but the solid military vehicle just kept pulling, never complaining or getting stuck. Despite her fear, a
              part of her was curious where the man was taking her. In some sort of bizarre emotional twist, getting
              back into the car of her own will broke something inside her. The man was scary, she was petrified of him,
              but he hasn’t hurt her so far. Everything he did was measured. She remembered how he effortlessly lifted
              her by her neck, then carried her like she was some sort of a plastic doll. The man was so strong, so
              powerful, he could have easily have raped her at any point, and there would be nothing she could do to
              stop him. The man was built like a beast. He looked like one of those prized Belgian bulls, but he wasn’t
              too muscular, just right, just perfect.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally shook her head, realizing what she was thinking about. The man was evil. He is her kidnapper, her
              rapist. She was a victim, and she had to be wise, play her role, the role he put her in and buy her time.
              Sooner or later, the man will make a mistake. Sooner or later, there will be an opportunity for her to
              escape and then take it. Until then, she had to stick to her bargain, do what she promised, no matter how
              distasteful it was to her. She had to obey the man, fuck the man, do everything and more, go above and
              beyond to convince him that she will stick to what she promised, then take her chance and run.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the car drove through the wilderness in darkness, Sally steeled herself for what’s to come. If the man
              just forced himself on her, she would be broken and violated. Still, as it took so long, she had enough
              time to process it, get ready, get her mind, heart, and body to a place where she could handle it. There
              was no doubt in her mind that the man will rape her. Regardless of her feeling about it, it was
              inevitable, unavoidable, something that will happen. Her survival, however, depended on her being
              level-headed and in control. She couldn’t let herself fall apart, lose her self control. She had to be
              strong and wait for the right moment and only then act. Broken people can’t act; they just react. She was
              a powerful, independent woman. She was strong and knew she could do it; she was a fighter, she was going
              to survive.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally’s inner monologue pep talk made her feel better, stronger, determined until the car started to slow
              down then finally stopped. As the headlamps illuminated the space ahead of them, Sally saw an old,
              dilapidated wooden house falling apart. It was apparent to Sally that it was their destination. She felt
              her tears starting to flow, her panic rose. None of what she told herself will come to pass. Nobody can
              live in that house. Clearly, the man was some sort of a psycho. He was going to rape her and kill her
              there, or do god knows what with her. She felt her soul suddenly die, in sheer panic and despair. The
              shivers and shakes have returned, and she curled up into a fetal position and cried.
            </p>

            <p>
              Loud metal banging sound came from the outside, then car doors opened, and the man reached for Sally,
              pulling her out of the car, letting her drop into the soft grass. Before she realized what was happening,
              the man attached a long metal chain to her neck. “Oh, Jesus, Oh, god! Please! Oh my god! No, please no”
              went through Sally’s mind. She was in a sheer state of panic, hyperventilating, her heartbeat going a mile
              a second, tears in free flow, sobs uncontrollably coming out. She couldn’t think about anything. There was
              just fear.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man disappeared somewhere for a while. At first, Sally felt relieved, but as time passed, she started
              to get even more scared, left alone chained in the middle of the field. She was about to scream when she
              saw the man return and put something on the ground in front of her, then disappear again.
            </p>

            <p>
              Touching the object, she realized it was a thermos flask. She opened it and smelled the content. It was
              just water. Hesitant to drink it, afraid it was drugged, she licked it, then took a small sip followed by
              a bigger one. She almost choked seeing the man return with a scythe. An image of Grimm the reaper flashed
              in her mind. The second flash was an image of the man disembowelling her and raping her dead body. Before
              her imagination could get better of her, she saw the man was cutting the grass in a wide circular pattern.
              “Is he going to rape me there?” She wandered in fear, watching him clear a wide patch then collect rocks,
              placing them in some sort of a formation in the centre of the clearing. “This must be some sort of satanic
              ritual. He is going to sacrifice me”. All sorts of thoughts went through Sally’s mind in her confused,
              frightened state. She didn’t know what to think, what to expect. Her nerves were shot. Her mind played
              tricks on her. Everything she saw in her mind interpreted through a prism of a traumatic experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              She saw the man light a fire, immediately realizing how stupid she was to think about rituals; she almost
              laughed at herself. Still, her mind played some more tricks, convincing her that the man was going to burn
              her. The high levels of psychological stress and a constant state of panic, coupled with fear, made Sally
              irrational. It wasn’t until she saw the man start grilling meat that she realized what was happening “he
              is hungry”. Sally watched with fascination the squatting man prepare two steaks, smelling the grilled
              meat, her own mouth watered. She didn’t eat since before the kidnapping. She was starving; she would eat
              just about anything.
            </p>

            <p>
              Impatiently she watched the man prepare food. When it was done, he let the meat cool, still skewered by
              the sticks he used for grilling, then took a smaller steak and threw it on the ground in front of Sally,
              sitting down, chewing his own. It was at this moment that she realized what was going on. The man didn’t
              speak to her, mostly ignored her. He kept her on a chain, feeding her like a dog. She was a dog or at
              least a farm animal. The man certainly treated her as one. In all her imagination, she could never
              envisage this. She wasn’t a human, or instead, she was a human animal. All this time, she through how she
              was this poor, abused girl, raped by a violent man. Instead, she wasn’t even that. She was less than that.
              She was a little more like a pet. In fact, she was less than a pet “I am livestock”. Sally felt her tears
              bubble up again. She just sat there frozen in silence, tears quietly running down her face. She felt
              another piece of her soul breaking off. There wasn’t much of it left.
            </p>

            <p>
              After eating his stake, the man threw some thicker wood on the fire and just laid down on the ground
              covering his face with a cowboy hat and slept. With nobody watching her debase herself, she reached for
              the meat and ate, feeling like she was accepting what the man was turning her into, hating herself for it.
              “Domesticated like a dog, all it took was some food”, she whispered in disgust. As she finished her food,
              a thought popped into her mind, how she was a vegetarian, she shouldn’t be eating meat. It was so random,
              so bizarre, she almost laughed. This brought back sweet memories of Moni and how she missed her. Curling
              up in a fetal position, laying in a soft yellowing grass, Sally thought of Moni, listening to the wind and
              cried herself to sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gentle sea-breeze touched the naked bodies of young women gathered on the beach. Moni stood in the middle
              of a semicircle, facing the morning waves gently caressing the shore. It was getting bright in the east.
              The sun was just about to come out. One of the women spoke. “We give thanks to the Origin and welcome the
              gift of light”. The rest of the women chanted as one, “blessed is the gift of light; blessed is the
              Origin”, then together they hummed in a soothing tone. Carried by the pure beauty of the moment, Moni
              watched the sunrise, filling her with light. She felt its warmth on her skin and closed the eyes adding to
              the hum. Moni felt her worry and pain just drain away, and there was just this very moment, the presence,
              in the now, complete and utter peace. She took a deep breath, smelling the salty air, and just let go.
              Tears rolled down her face. For the first time since Sally’s disappearance, she felt fine. She felt alive.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the ceremony ended, the girls gathered their clothes, going about their business, when an older girl
              approached Moni, asking, “how do you feel?”. Moni smiled, taking another deep breath, “thank you for
              inviting me. I feel better, I feel alive”. The older girl responded, “blessed is the gift of life”, two
              other girls adding, “blessed is the Origin”. The older girl extended her palm “come, let’s swim”. Taking
              her hand, she followed her, few more girls joining them. Moni swam, enjoying the cold water, refreshing
              her body and clearing her mind. Somehow she felt better, she was still worried sick about Sally, but the
              welcoming ceremony untangled her emotions, unblocked her mind. Before, she had nothing, but now she had
              faith. She joined the girls when they invited her out of desperation. She would do anything but expected a
              little. In turn, she felt blessed, like a huge weight coming off her shoulders, a burden she couldn’t
              carry alone. The ceremony allowed her to open for one second and decompress. It was all it took for her to
              find her light again “blessed is the gift of light, blessed is the Origin”, she mumbled.
            </p>

            <p>
              The girls swam for ten minutes, then pulled Moni out and sat on the sand in a circle. The older girl
              pulled out a book and opened it on her lap. At that moment, a cute blonde jogger Moni’s age came upon
              them. Surprised at seeing a group of beautiful naked women sitting on the sand, curious as to why she
              asked, “whatcha doing?”. One of the girls turned to her, “come, sit down with us, we&#39;ll tell you about
              the Origin”, the girl hesitated then shrugged, about to sit when another girl said, “no clothes please”.
              The jogger stopped, looked around her, thinking, “this is too weird, I better leave”, when the third girl
              smiled at her, “come on, don’t be shy, you’re very pretty, sit with us”. The jogger looked at them, they
              all seemed nice, and it did sound like an adventure. She said “ok”, quickly undressed and sat on the sand,
              joining the small circle. “I’m Emma”, she said; the girls introduced themselves, then the one with the
              book started to read, “In the beginning, there was void, neither darkness nor light, wind or rain, human
              or god”.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Cold, it is so cold, I am freezing”; Sally’s teeth chattered. She woke up many times at night feeling
              cold, sleeping on the grass. She moved closer to the fire, but that didn’t help much. She felt the cold in
              her bones. Looking at the man sleep, she wondered how did he do it. He was dressed in light clothes, which
              couldn’t keep him that warm. He didn’t move at all since he lay down. In her mind, Sally imagined that the
              man died; she observed him, noticing his chest rising in a slow, steady rhythm. Now that he slept, he
              didn’t seem so scary anymore. Sleeping by the fire with a cowboy hat on his face, he looked like one of
              those men from old western films, a gunslinger type on some sort of a mission, not like a bandit hiding
              from the law, more like the hero.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally studied the man in the light of fire for a long time. For the first time, she had a chance to look
              at a grown man in the prime of his power, a strong man, not a boy or a weaker person like a banker or
              engineer. She knew from her experience the man was immensely powerful, but despite all that he’s done to
              her, somehow, he didn’t come across as genuinely violent. His eyes were like death, hard to look at; so
              scary and cold, Sally shivered just remembering them. His actions were measured, purposeful. She
              remembered the man’s hand grabbing a fistful of her hair just behind her head, pulling her out of the car.
              She remembered the goosebumps instantly spreading over her body. What she felt when he did that wasn’t
              pain. It was arousal suppressed by fear and the sense of panic.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alone like that in darkness, she had to admit to herself that if she wasn’t lesbian, if she met this man
              in a bar or somewhere, and he didn’t have those scary eyes. If he bought her a drink, she would have let
              him take her home. She would have enjoyed him pulling her hair, getting on top of her with his powerful
              body. Absentmindedly she played with her chain. How many times did she play this fantasy with Moni? To be
              kidnapped, tied up in a cave and used violently by men who didn’t care about her feelings, just their own
              needs. She remembered how Moni put on a strap-on dildo and fucked her hard doggy style, pulling on her
              leash while her arms were tied to the headboard. She came so hard then, loving every moment of it. If she
              met that man in a bar and he was her man, she would let her do all this and more, loving every moment of
              it. She would let him kidnap her, take her to a field, keep her on a chain and fuck her any way he liked.
              She would, in fact, love it; it would be a fulfilment of her deepest fantasy, but the reality was very
              different. This man was a stranger who kidnapped her, took her away from her love. He was strong,
              masculine and manly; tall, dark and handsome, brooding type, but he was a stranger, some psycho, a
              dangerous man, a rapist.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally dozed off thinking about the man and her predicament, reminiscing the time spent with Moni,
              imagining her warm body, heating her up. Many times at night, she would awake in a shiver and think
              herself back to sleep, always thinking of her love, wrapped up around her, heating her, keeping her warm,
              loving and protecting her. Sally woke again just before dawn, seeing faint light on the horizon. She got
              up and walked towards the morning as far as her long chain would allow her, some thirty feet. Imagining in
              her head how Moni would be doing the same, she said, “I give thanks to the Origin and welcome the gift of
              light. Blessed is the gift of light, blessed is the Origin”. As she said it, the sun emerged behind the
              distant mountain. Sally felt the warm sunshine penetrate her body, cleanse her soul like a million
              sparkles emerging from her body and flying out into the heavens, becoming little stars. She closed her
              eyes, letting go of yesterday and tomorrow; only “now” remained. In wave after wave of energy, she let go
              of everything, of all her fear, pain and sadness. Tears rolled down Sally’s cheeks. She felt it all go
              away, all the darkness inside her replaced by the light, filling her up with love and hope, freeing her
              from all attachments. Naked in the field, chained to the ground for the first time in her life, she felt
              free.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean massaged his head, looking at the whiteboard. All that he knew about the case was there, all the
              evidence mapped and interlinked. Hours of effort scrubbing through the videos feeds from cameras several
              blocks away yielded a stroke of luck that turned again into a dead end. Given the estimated timeframe of
              the kidnapping, the team listed all the cars passing by. They checked thousands of license plate numbers
              against the database. One of them was reported stolen. They blew up the photos and saw the man driving,
              except that he was wearing a motorcycle helmet. Dean immediately knew he was the guy. Within days the car
              was found abandoned at a truck stop, dusting for prints, resulting in nothing; the man wore a full
              motorcycle suit and gloves. The team looked at more video evidence for weeks prior, having a hit on a
              matt-black sports motorcycle with a guy wearing full black gear but no license plate; it was another dead
              end.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean stared at the blown up, enhanced picture of a man on a motorcycle, knowing in his heart he was the
              man who took Sally. The forensics put him at six-foot-five, just like Dean estimated from the scratches on
              the wall. The man’s posture looked like someone agile and muscular; the way he rode was practised and
              confident. He wasn’t some weird creepy guy pissed off at the feminists, trying to take revenge on one of
              their leaders. This guy did everything on purpose; he was planed, precise and methodical. The man clearly
              had skill and patience; he must have watched Sally for months. Dean was convinced that it wasn’t Man’s
              first time in girls’ home when he came to take Sally. He was there before. He knew the exact layout and
              content of the house. The man set a trap and patiently waited, decisively striking at the right time. Just
              the fact he wore a helmet inside a car, as well as the choice and colour of the vehicle, spoke enough to
              Dean. The man knew exactly what he was doing. He was familiar with police capabilities, potentially the
              processes as well. The car that was left was placed on that road on purpose, sending the search in the
              wrong direction if it ever came that far. There were no traces past that point; the trail went cold; It
              was a dead end.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pissed off with that, Dean smashed a cup against the wall, attracting coworkers&#39; attention. “What is
              going on?” His boss snapped at him. Dean just closed the folder, dropped it into the unsolved drawer,
              kicking it shut with his foot and walked out. “Motherfucker, fucking motherfucker”, Dean fumed, walking
              out of the building towards his car, just to realize he forgot his keys at his desk. In impotent
              frustration, he punched the car window, breaking straight through it, taking a pack of cigarettes and
              lighter out of the glove compartment and walked away into the park.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean wandered for several hours, his mind replaying his past. He barely noticed the people around him. In
              deep emotional turmoil, he marched on, “Are you ok? Tell me, how do you really feel?”. His mind replayed
              the first meeting he had with Cyrus. He was the genius psychiatrist that specialized in psychopaths and
              abnormal psychology, author of many books, professor at a local university and special consultant to the
              police and FBI. Cyrus came highly recommended. He saved his colleague’s life, and he was the only person
              who could fathom his pain and perhaps help him. “Of course I’m not fucking ok, I am broken, I am enraged,
              I am this close to pulling a gun and shooting someone or myself”.<br />“Hit me!” Said Cyrus, “come on, get
              it all out, hit me now”. Dean tried hard to control his anger, but Cyrus kept pushing, pressing his
              buttons “come on, little bitch, show me what you’ve got”. The world went dark, and Dean swung with all his
              might. In his head, he saw Cyrus fall, but something else happened. Cyrus blocked his punch with ease,
              slapping Dean hard “come on cunt, is that all you’ve got”. Dean went nuts. The two of them ended up in a
              full-blown brawl, destroying the furniture, breaking glassware. Dean gave it his best, pouring all his
              anger and strength into beating up Cyrus, but he just laughed, mocking him, taunting him. At one point,
              Cyrus’s secretary Sunny put her head in through the door, just to slam it shut the next second, narrowly
              avoiding the chair mid-air.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, Cyrus punched Dean so hard in his stomach that he flew across the room, landing on a three-seater
              sofa, breathing heavily. All his frustration and anger drained away. Sunny came in again, and Cyrus calmly
              asked her for two cups of coffee and to call for cleanup for the demolished office.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the course of his visits, Dean and Cyrus have got to know each other quite well. Cyrus managed to dig
              him out of the hole, taught him how to decompress, deal with his pain and curb his anger, move on with his
              life, and find his purpose again.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean stopped walking after hitting the beach. He didn’t plan it. It just happened that way. He felt so
              hot, still angry, so pissed off; without thinking, he quickly disrobed and, wearing just his boxer shorts
              jumped into cold water and went for a swim. He swam out far, wrestled with the waves, then struggled back.
              His head cleared, he calmed down, starting to think, finding his centre like Cyrus taught him.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean sat on a large piece of driftwood looking at the waves, breathing, deep in thought when a voice
              interrupted his mental journey “mister, are you ok?”. He looked to the, seeing a little girl with her mom
              a few yards away. “Yes, honey, thank you for asking”. A little blonde girl with the most penetrating blue
              eyes he saw giggled “what is this?” She asked, pointing at Dean’s many scars. He rarely went shirtless.
              His upper body was crisscrossed with scars and burn marks, several knife holes, there was a long
              rectangular scar where his skin was cut and peeled off; it frightened most people.
            </p>

            <p>“These are old scars from an accident from a long time ago.”</p>

            <p>“Does it hurt ?”</p>

            <p>
              “It used to but not anymore” Dean smiled at the little girl, thinking how he never saw a more beautiful
              girl. She looked like a little angel, watching him with her curious emphatic eyes.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Can I touch it?” She asked with genuine concern, “go ahead. It really doesn’t hurt”. The little girl’s
              soft fingers gently touched his scars. That was the first time Dean let anyone touch them. Her warm little
              hand felt soothing as if it was healing him with her concern and love.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two gorgeous women walked up to the little girl. Before they start asking questions, Dean offered her hand
              to the little girl, “My name is Dean Taylor. I work as a detective for the Los Angeles police department”.
              The little girl’s eyes grew big and even sparklier than before, if that was possible. She took his hand,
              shaking it seriously and said, “my name is Eve, this is my mom Kitty” pointing at the beautiful slim
              brunette, “and this is my other mom Joy”, pointing at gorgeous long-haired natural blonde whose face and
              body belonged on the covers of fashion magazines. Eve came closer, covering her mouth and whispered,
              “shhh! She is a cat. It’s a secret.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean offered his hand to two women. Kitty said, “nice to meet you”. Joy just meowed. The four of them sat
              on the log together, talking. The girl&#39;s voice was soothing. The subtle timbre of her voice vibrated
              as she spoke, resonating inside him, calming him, putting the runaway emotions into their place. “Thank
              you for talking with me”, Dean said as the women got up to leave “before I met you, I was distraught, my
              head swirling with thoughts; your words calmed me, brought me peace”. Kitty squatted in front of the man,
              took his hands into hers and their eyes met. She kissed his forehead and said, “blessed is the gift of
              peace. Blessed is the Origin”, then got up and walked away. Eve run-up to the man, embraced him tight,
              kissed his cheek and said, “blessed is the gift of life”, then ran after her mothers.
            </p>

            <p>
              Dean felt his tears falling. It was all so simple. Simple enough for a child to see it. For the first time
              in a long time, Dean wept. He sat on that log till sunset, feeling the sea breeze, breathing the salty
              air, feeling reborn. As the sun faded, he muttered, “blessed is the gift of life”, then he got dressed,
              walked up to the street and hailed a cab. He’s got work to do. The manhunt wasn’t over. It will never be
              over. No matter how long it takes, he will find that cunt and make him pay.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally screamed, waking up, suddenly seeing the naked man standing above her. His massive erection hovering
              inches from her face. His cock larger than any she’s ever seen before, a cock of a man, not a boy she used
              to date. Even the married guy whom she fucked was much smaller than this colossal thing. All the dildos
              Sally and Moni bought were smaller than this monstrous, pulsating thing. “Omg! It’s happening! I am
              getting raped! Omg! Omg! Omg! Please no! Oh god, please don’t rape me, please!” Her mind exploded in
              panic. Sally&#39;s resolve to be strong shattering to million pieces. Again, she was just a little girl
              about to be raped by this huge man with a monstrous penis. “Oh, god! Please don’t let him do it to me”.
              The man pulled her up by her chain, replacing it with a leash and started to pull. Sally followed like an
              obedient puppy knowing this was it. He is taking her to the house to fuck her, take her against her will,
              defile her. After this, she will never be the same. She will be ruined.
            </p>

            <p>
              Confused, Sally didn’t know what was happening. Instead of the house, the man tied her to a rock next to a
              well. Sally’s heart beating so hard she thought it would jump out of her throat. Se watched the naked man
              pull out a bucket of freezing water and empty it all over himself. A few ice-cold drops splashed on Sally.
              They stung how cold they were. Again the man pulled out more water then unceremoniously emptied the bucked
              all over Sally.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thousands of little knives and needles simultaneously pricked Sally’s skin. Whatever Sally expected, it
              wasn’t this. She screamed in surprise and sudden pain, begging the man to stop; he just ignored her,
              reaching for a rough brush and started brushing Sally all over her body. If she thought the water was
              terrible, the rough brush on sensitive cold skin felt like he was peeling it off. Sally screamed and
              begged him to stop, wishing at this moment she was being raped instead. This was the most painful,
              excruciating experience she’s ever had.
            </p>

            <p>
              Men dragged her back to the fire, re-chaining her, then gave her a mug of hot coffee. “Oh god! The heat!
              Sweet heat! Jesus, Mary and Joseph, such wonderful heat” never before has Sally been more thankful for the
              heat, she almost purred. She saw the man in a completely different light. Regardless of how evil and
              fucked up he was, at least he cared enough to give her heat. Sally quickly swallowed a few gulps of hot
              liquid, feeling warm inside out. “Oh my god, this is the best coffee I ever tried”, it was the most
              incredible feeling. Both of them stood close to the fire drying up in silence. While drinking her coffee,
              Sally secretly watched the man, studying him.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man was tall and very muscular, like a boxer or martial artists. His strong chest was covered with
              sparse short black hair muscles crisscrossed with veins. There were a few scars on his back, some straight
              ones from cuts and a few irregular ones Sally couldn’t figure out from what. Hist big strong hands held
              onto a cup similar to Sally’s. The cup looked tiny in his hands, like a toy. Firm muscular butt ended in
              powerful legs, keeping the man rooted to the ground. When he turned to her, Sally almost gasped, seeing
              again his now flaccid cock. His powerful organ dangled between his legs in front of a large pair of balls.
              The man’s muscles danced as he moved, his abs looking like someone photoshopped them in a sports magazine.
              Despite her better judgment, Sally wondered how it would feel to get fucked by such a machine, to take his
              massive beast inside her and surrender to his thrusts.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man got dressed, pulled out a bag of granola bars, took two and threw the rest at Sally. Immediately
              she sat down, ripping one open, stuffing her face with it; it tasted so good. She lifted her head to say
              “thank you”, but the man was already gone. He drove away, leaving her chained in the grass by the fire,
              with a pack of granola bars, coffee and water. A bunch of extra wood layered nearby so she could keep
              herself warm.
            </p>

            <p>
              At first, Sally felt a great sense of relief when the man left her. She was free; she could run away.
              Sally tried to get herself unchained, but that wasn’t going to happen anytime. Besides, where would she
              go? She was in the middle of nowhere, it took car hours to get there, there was nowhere to go.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally spent hours sitting in the grass, completely alone, thinking about her life, about the man, how he
              washed her, fed her. She thought about his huge cock, his balls swaying. She remembered how it was erect,
              veins popping out, throbbing in her face. Sally tried to think about something else, anything, but it kept
              coming back. The more she tried not to think about it, the more it came back. At one point, Sally just
              gave up, letting her imagination loose. If she was going to rape her, she might as well get mentally
              prepared for it. Her vivid imagination ran free. She imagined the man on top of her, slamming his powerful
              cock into her, holding her by her neck, pushed against the ground, drilling her endlessly with powerful
              thrusts, mercilessly without any concern about her emotions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unconsciously Sally’s hand found its way to her pussy, surprisingly wet and sensitive. She absentmindedly
              rubbed her clit, imagining the most graphic sex scenes with the man. In her mind, the man chained her
              collar to the ground. She couldn’t move, couldn’t run away. He would come every hour and fuck her, harder
              each time, pumping her with his sperm, squeezing her tits painfully to remind her she was his, he owned
              her, she was his slave, his fuck toy, a farm animal to fuck and breed as he liked, to violently abuse as
              he saw fit.
            </p>

            <p>
              A long scream spread through the prairie, Sally’s body squirming in a powerful orgasm. Her pussy twitched,
              contracting so hard as if to expunge some unseen intruder. It took Sally good twenty minutes for her mind
              to clear from post-orgasmic fog, her hand still rubbed her pussy, feeling the slippery wetness it spat
              out.
            </p>

            <p>
              “I am such a disgusting pervert”, Sally said loudly and cried, covering her face with her hands. “How
              could I masturbate to that” she blamed herself for getting aroused by her rapist, for violating herself,
              for enjoying the idea of being brutally taken. She lay in the grass, blaming her body for betraying her,
              blaming her mind for starting it in the first place. She tried to force herself to hate the man. “I hate
              you, I’ll kill you”, she shouted, not believing the single word. It was true the man kidnapped her, but he
              didn’t rape her, it was all her, she did it, she wanted it. “I am such a horrible slut. I deserve to be
              taken and raped”, she spoke to the wind. It didn’t say anything back.
            </p>

            <p>
              Slowly she calmed down, started to rationalize, blaming her situation, tiredness and cold, but no matter
              how hard, she couldn’t bring herself to hate the man. He hurt her with a brush and cold water in the
              morning, but she needed a wash, and there was no other option. He made her hot coffee, fed her, kept her
              warm. She kept interrupting her train of thoughts. For some stupid reason, her mind kept justifying man’s
              actions, finding excuses, defending him.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nothing made sense anymore. Sally just knew she hated being alone with her thoughts. The time passed, it
              was getting dark. Sally started to worry then panic about being alone. “What if he doesn’t come back? What
              if he’s hurt and can’t return”. She found herself missing the man, hoping nothing terrible happened to
              him, wishing him to come back. The darker it got, the more panicked Sally felt. “Please come back, I
              forgive you for kidnapping me. Please don’t leave me alone here. I promise I’ll be good and obedient. I’ll
              honour our bargain, I will be your woman, just please come back”, she kept mumbling, talking to the wind,
              worried about the man.
            </p>

            <p>
              A great sense of relief washed over her when she saw car lights in the distance approaching slowly “oh
              god! Thank you”, she said, impatiently waiting for the man to return. Feeling ashamed of her thoughts and
              feelings, she forced herself to feel angry, but she knew it was all fake. She was so glad to see the man.
              She would kiss him if she dared.
            </p>

            <p>
              “He caught a horse? He can catch horses?” Sally thought in surprise and awe. She never knew anyone who can
              catch a horse, especially not so big and beautiful one. The man led the horse, and it followed, “it is
              tamed! He tamed it! Omg!” Sally’s eyes followed the man, a feeling of growing respect for him. Suddenly a
              bird fell into her lap, and she screamed in surprise. The man gave her a small knife and left. He looked
              like he bathed in the mud; a strong sense of man-sweat wafted in the air. It was something Sally always
              found repugnant in the gym. The men with poor hygiene flexing their muscles trying to impress the ladies
              whose stomach was turning at their stench. This time, however, the pungent odour was exciting. It was the
              smell of a man after hard work in nature, a different kind of smell. Unconsciously she kept taking a deep
              breath.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man left her there with a dead bird and a knife “he wants me to clean it” she didn’t know where to
              begin. She pulled on a feather and almost cried. “I can’t do that. I am such a loser”, she sat there,
              unable to do anything. Twenty minutes later, she saw the man return naked, his massive cock swaying
              between his legs. Instantly it reminded her of an orgasm she had, her face turning red in shame. To make
              it worse, the man sat next to her, pulling the feathers with his strong hands. His shoulder touching hers.
              It felt like her skin was getting singed. Discretely she gave in to her urges, breathing in the man’s
              scent, trying to will her pussy to stop getting wet, resulting in getting turned on even more.
            </p>

            <p>
              This all stopped as man sliced the bird, ripped the entrails out and cut off its head. Sally almost
              vomited seeing that. A hard break to her arousal, it made her instantly sick. The man cut up the turkey in
              pieces, giving her metal skewers and left to wash his hands. Sally calmed down a little. She knew what to
              do now. It was the first time she tried a wild turkey. The meat tasted so good. She didn’t care what it
              was because she was starving. She just loved the taste. A thought of her vegetarianism crossed her mind,
              and she almost laughed at herself. “I was such a privileged idiot”. Here in nature, in the middle of
              nowhere, Sally learned how little pleasures mean so much.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man fell asleep quickly, except this time he was naked as her. His clothes washed, drying on the rope.
              Sitting in tall grass, Sally watched the man breathe. Quietly she studied every inch of her body. She’s
              given up trying to control her body. It seemed to have the mind of its own. For hours she tried to fall
              asleep, tossing and turning, always opening her eyes, watching the man sleep. She watched his naked,
              powerful body, feeling her pussy getting wet, then quickly turning her back to him, closing her eyes, but
              that was even worse than before. The most explicit of fantasies rolled through her head. For some reason,
              the men in her deepest fantasies she used to have since she was a teenager got a face and body. Sally used
              to fantasize about being taken, beaten and raped, sold to sheikhs and used by faceless men. She remembered
              those clearly. She used to masturbate to that for years. Now all those men in her fantasies got a face;
              they became this man, her rapist, her owner.
            </p>

            <p>
              She got up in frustration, changing her position over and again, the stupid thoughts refusing to live her
              head. She was desperately tired just couldn’t quiet her mind. In sheer frustration, she finally hid in
              tall grass, through which she looked at the naked man and slowly played with her pussy. She was only a few
              yards away from him, able to see his cock in great detail; imagining it extend and plough inside her, then
              her body stiffened, she bit her lip and came.
            </p>

            <p>
              Right before dawn, Sally did another welcoming ceremony then sat in the grass studying the man. His
              morning erection slowly rose, Sally watched it carefully, her pussy on fire, but she forced herself to sit
              still. Seeing the man stir, she quickly hid her face, avoiding the man’s eye contact. He got up and
              leashed her. She followed him, mentally ready for what comes next.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally spent the whole day watching the man work. She never saw so much stamina, so much power and
              determination. Sally saw him shovel a trench around the house. He was like a bulldozer, lifting huge rocks
              she wouldn’t be able to move. The man worked tirelessly until midday. She lined up the grilled turkey for
              him to eat, serving him like a wife would. The man patted Sally&#39;s head for it in thanks. It felt good;
              it felt gentle. She shook her head, “I’m here against my will. I am a prisoner”, she kept forcing herself
              to think, believing it less with every moment. What kind of slut masturbates to her rapist, “but he didn’t
              rape me” the idea just popped in her head. Immediately another voice latched onto it, the new one, finding
              excuses for the man, justifying his actions. It was a disturbing and frightening thought. Sally was angry
              with herself. Inside her head, she was screaming, but that other voice just wouldn’t shut up.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally watched the strong man work tirelessly, “how much energy does he have?” The man looked like some
              sort of angry god, ripping down the roof like it was straw; such violence without any rage, such
              unstoppable raw, endless power. There was so much brutality in his movements. “That is my man”, a thought
              popped into her mind. She slapped herself for even thinking it “this is not my man, he kidnapped me”, she
              paused for a second, realizing her brain trapped her in a logical loop. “I am his woman” she was shocked
              at this revelation; she was indeed his woman. He took her, and she belonged to him; she was his woman in
              the most literal of all senses.
            </p>

            <p>
              That thought kept reverberating in Sally’s mind. “I am his woman”, the idea felt revolting to her yet
              somehow good. She couldn’t explain why it was like that. She was confused as hell. After ripping out the
              roof like some sort of hulk, the man came down and took care of the horse. Sally watched with interest and
              attention how gentle the man was with a horse, how kindly he treated it and brushed his mane. “I am also
              like a horse. The man owns me too”, she thought, instantly starting another round of inner dialogues. What
              shocked her the most was that she felt jealous. She was envious of how nice the man treated the horse. He
              stroke it gently, fed him fresh apples. The horse didn’t seem to be afraid of the man. In fact, he liked
              him; he pushed his nose into the man’s shoulder, asking him to touch him some more.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man went to wash up, returning naked again, squatting by the fire. While he was away, Sally heated up
              some turkey and brought it to him. “I’m feeding my man”. She sat next to him without fear. She also was
              his property like a horse. Inhaling his scent, she felt her arousal grow, but she forced herself to sit
              still, preserving little self-respect and chastity she had left, knowing it was all a farce. “Whom am I
              kidding? I like this man. I hate him, but I like him”. He was a man unlike any she saw before, so strong,
              masculine and powerful; so brutal yet so kind. She couldn’t deny the truth, she felt drawn to him, and she
              resented him for the same reason.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man lay on the grass again; within minutes, he was asleep. “I was such an idiot”, Sally thought. So
              many times, she spoke about the evils of men, and she was right. This man did an evil thing to her but
              spending a few days with him in the wilderness showed her how wrong she was to say that. The man was a
              man, a real man. He knew what he wanted and went for it. He worked hard, demanded no thanks or praise. He
              did it because he was a man. She saw now what her grandparents used to talk about. The men and women need
              each other, they are so different, and that’s a good thing. It is those differences, when combined
              together, that give something bigger than the sum of its parts. The men and women belonged to each other,
              they were the polar opposites, but together they were complete. They augmented each other’s strengths and
              weaknesses. They needed each other like they needed air. It wasn’t about love or sex; it was about life.
              The girls who never saw a real man in action couldn’t understand this, his power, strength, sheer
              determination, unbendable will, stone-cold and hard as steel. Such man needs someone to fight for, someone
              who gives him softness and love, someone who takes his brutal force and takes it in explosive, passionate
              sex, just to show him that he can be loved, taken care of when he’s asleep. Sally didn’t feel demeaned by
              serving man some food. On the contrary, she felt like she’s helping, doing something, no matter how little
              to add to his work. She might not be able to build houses or tear the roofs, but she was able to feed him,
              give him a reason for doing something, a purpose, a goal.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally watched the man sleep, cold wind blowing into her back. She knew she won’t be able to sleep, just
              like the last night. She was too turned on. Like before, she masturbated, watching the man’s naked body
              while he slept. Long after her orgasm, floating on a cloud, she looked at the man, her urgent need gone.
              “I am his woman. I belong to this man”, she kept thinking, listening to the sound of the wind, feeling it
              cool her body.
            </p>

            <p>
              At one moment, something just snapped inside her. An image of the horse rubbing the nose against the man’s
              shoulder kept coming back. She got up, quietly walked to the man and sat next to him. She could see every
              detail from up close. She sat there for maybe an hour, observing every pore in the moonlight and nearby
              fire. In one moment, Sally made a decision, lay next to the man, then wrapped herself around him “if I am
              his woman, then he is my man”. Her body shivered in excitement, her adrenaline pumping hard. The man woke
              up at her first touch, then just stretched his arm, pulling her in closer, wrapping it around her. Sally
              trembled in sheer excitement. She felt his male body, so hot and hairy, so different from Moni. His smell
              overwhelmed her senses, her pussy instantly started to drool. “I want this man! Omg! I actually want him!”
              She couldn’t believe her body. It was surreal. How could she ever even imagine something like that? The
              man took her like one takes a puppy, she was his, she realized it now, but she couldn’t understand her
              reaction to him. It was deep, primal and undeniable. Her mind said one thing, telling stories she didn’t
              believe. Her pussy was on fire, wanting the man to take her and breed her. Her whole body reacted to him
              like gasoline does to fire.
            </p>

            <p>
              Too scared to do anything, she forced herself to calm down. The warmth of the man, his strong hand holding
              her, it felt so good, so safe. Sally lay her head on the man’s chest, taking deep breaths, getting high on
              his smell “my man, my man”, she kept repeating in her head until the world went dark and she fell asleep.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally felt stirring and woke up in a daze. She slept like a baby; in fact, she was surprised to realize
              that this was the best sleep she ever had in her life. The man’s huge cock rested fully erect against her
              leg; she saw it up close, her pussy instantly wet, saliva in her mouth. She wanted it like a drowning
              person wanted air.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man pulled her up and lead her to the well, then both of them came back drinking coffee; it was
              granola bars time again. Sally spent another day watching the man work hard and take care of the horse. He
              was erecting the tent. She saw how she could help him but stayed away. Clearly, if he wanted her to help,
              he would have asked. It was a man’s work, and he was strong. He spent the whole day working, harder than
              the day before. Sally sat munching on granola bars watching the man “her man”. The man lifted large pieces
              of wood, nailing them to the structure. He worked like a man possessed, sweat dripping down his body.
              Sally watched that like in a movie, her pussy burning, begging for the release. Once she accepted the fact
              that the man owned her, it was like someone gave her permission to stop fighting him.
            </p>

            <p>
              They ate corned beef and beans the man cooked in a pan. Sally could never imagine the two ingredients she
              hated could taste so good together. She ate with such gusto, the man gave her half of his portion as well,
              stroking her head gently. Sally really liked that, the man stroke her like a horse “he cares”, she wanted
              more, but he left and unpacked a sleeping bag inside the tent then laid on top of it. Sally was in agony;
              she was in desperate need, She felt horny the whole day and really needed to masturbate, but now she
              couldn’t see the man. Deciding not to risk it, she ran to the tent, wrapping herself around the man “my
              man”, immediately putting her head on his shoulder, sticking her nose into his neck. She inhaled a robust
              masculine scent like the best perfume, almost like a junky getting a hit.
            </p>

            <p>
              The following morning Sally didn’t feel so good, her head hurt badly, she had a cough. She couldn’t say
              what was worse, the illness or the horniness. She tried to will the man to stay in bed, hug her keep her
              warm, take care of her “how stupid can he be? Can’t he see I am not feeling well? Can’t he see I am
              horny?” She wasn’t in a good mood, her throat was sore, she had a bit of a cough. “It must be the sudden
              change of weather”, she thought, dreading the bath. The man got up; Sally expected him to yank her leash.
              Instead, he wrapped her up in a warm sleeping bag, “he cares!”. The man disappeared, coming back shortly
              with fresh coffee and a bunch of pills; she didn’t want to take them, but the man wasn’t asking; he
              grabbed her jaw, squeezed it open like one does with a dog and just stuffed her mouth with the pills. He
              made her drink it all down with hot coffee and refilled her cup.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man took care of the horse and made sure Sally was ok, cleaning the ground around the house, storing
              some dry firewood in the tent. At noon he jumped on a horse, coming back a couple of hours later with a
              bag. She saw him take a pot and fill it with something, then put it on the fire, adding more wood.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally watched him get back to the house and bare-chested nail heavy wooden sheets to the roof structure.
              The cold rain soaked his body, but he ignored it. Like some sort of a giant, he pushed and pulled, carried
              heavy pieces of wood. Something four people would carry, he lifted in one hand and pulled it up. Wrapped
              in warmth, she watched his muscles tense and work hard on a herculean task to erect the roof. She realized
              at this moment what the man was doing and why. He was building them a roof, a home. He wanted to have a
              house, to share it with her, “he cares, he wants me”. Sally felt a little tear come out of the corner of
              her eye. The man might have been a crazy lunatic, a kidnapper, and god knows what else, but he cared. In
              his crazy mind, he wanted to have a home. Sally could understand that. It was heartbreaking to watch the
              man work in a cold rain, the hot mist surrounding him from the heat of his body. Sally saw the sheer
              strength of will by which the man carried heavy pieces of wood, where many would have faltered, even gave
              up he just worked. The sheer power, stamina and strength it took just to keep this insane tempo were
              beyond admirable. Even if she hated him from the bottom of her soul, she would grow to admire him now. He
              was putting the roof for the house where he wanted to take her, so she would be safe from the weather. The
              way he defied the rain told her the man would survive the worst winter sleeping in a tent covered with
              snow, but she wouldn’t. The house was for her.
            </p>

            <p>
              It took the man the rest of the day to get the panels done, then completely wet, he got back to the fire,
              ladled something into a bowl and gave it to Sally. In absolute horror, she realized the man cooked a
              snake. She would have vomited if she wasn’t so hungry, and the stew smelled divine. Tentatively she tried
              a little, and it tasted great. She stuffed her face as fast as she could “this is incredible”, she
              thought. It tasted better than it smelled. The man peeled her a baked potato, adding it with more stew to
              her bowl. Sally couldn’t believe the taste; she kept having more even after she was full.
            </p>

            <p>
              The man took care of the dishes, then joined her naked in the sleeping bag. He was ice cold, frozen to the
              bone. She immediately wrapped him up, getting on top to use her body heat to warm him. His cock went erect
              almost immediately, pressing har against her. Without thinking about what she was doing, acting purely
              automatic, her arm roamed the man&#39;s body, somehow ending wrapped around his pulsating cock. In shock,
              Sally realized what she’s done; she changed everything, took it to the next level. She didn’t want to do
              that, she certainly didn’t want to initiate it, but her hand had its own mind. Even as she froze, her hand
              gently squeezed the man’s large organ. She couldn’t help herself; it was the most fantastic feeling she
              couldn’t resist.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Omg! He is going to fuck me!” Her mind screamed as the man got on top of her, then to her surprise, the
              man slowly went down on her, eating her pussy, making her cum, then making her cum again. It was way too
              much, her little clit too sensitive. She tried to stop him repeatedly until he had enough, trapped her
              hand and ate her pussy regardless of her protests. Sally felt something deep building inside her,
              something she’s never felt before, something primal, irresistible, scary. Like a sleeping dragon waking
              up.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then it all hit her, the orgasm so powerful it took her breath away. Sally often read of those in books,
              thinking they were just literary exaggeration, but now she knew it was real. She felt it, the feeling
              stronger than million suns. She exploded like new years fireworks, her body taking control, her primal
              brain going on fire, stronger and stronger until the world was a bright light.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally woke up at dawn, still reeling from the most intense orgasm she ever experienced. Kidnapped or not,
              forced or consensual, nothing really mattered. It was all a blur. The man gave her something she would
              kill to get again. She was hooked like instant heroin. Knowledge was a curse. Her life was happy before
              she came like that, but now that she had the supermassive orgasm, she knew deep in her soul that her life
              would never be great again if she couldn’t get another one like that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Without thinking, Sally slowly peeled herself off the man, got between his legs and started to suck his
              cock. It felt huge, like sucking an orange, she could barely put it into her mouth, but it turned her on
              beyond any cock she handled before. It wasn’t its size but the promise of what it would bring. She saw the
              man wake up and watch her. She sucked faster, feeling the cock twitch in her mouth, then high-pressured
              flood, a torrent, tsunami of sperm blasted, filling her mouth. She swallowed hard, as fast as she could,
              drowning in sperm. At one moment, she thought she’ll choke and die. But the river slowly became a stream,
              then just a dribble, she sucked to get the last drop. She didn’t know how much sperm she swallowed, but
              she wasn’t hungry anymore. Her stomach was full of her man’s seed.
            </p>

            <p>
              The rest of the day was like a blur. The man worked and hunted, catching another bird. Sally cleaned it
              like the man showed her, not caring anymore about the disgusting things. She sat and watched the man “my
              man” work, feeling a sense of pride inside her. Sally knew that now she was his, sure he owned her, kept
              her on a chain, but now he owned her body and soul. She knew now that if ever the man kicked her out of
              his house, she would camp outside, begging him to take her back in, willing to do anything for another
              orgasm like that. She played with her chain smiling, “I am his! He owns me! He wants me! I belong to my
              man”. What once was a symbol of misery and debasement quickly became an assurance of the future. She
              looked at her engagement ring “my poor Moni” she loved her so much, but at that moment, if she was given a
              choice to stay with the man or go back to Moni, she would be stuck between the two.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sally took care of his man, fed him. After they finished, she happily joined him in the tent. Her hand
              went straight for the man’s cock then he took control over her. Before she knew what was happening, Sally
              felt a large bulbous head pushing her tight pussy open, far beyond anything she’s ever tried before. Even
              Moni’s fist felt smaller than that. In a few strokes, the man was entirely inside her. She felt something
              never experienced before, a colossal pressure against her cervix, sending incredible feeling throughout
              her body. She heard some women like that but never believed she’d be one of them. The man fucked her rough
              and hard, just like in her teenage fantasy. That deep feeling returned, her whole body electrified, ready
              for something big. Then it happened again, but this time much stronger. Sally couldn’t breathe, just
              scream so loud like she’s never screamed before.
            </p>

            <p>
              When she woke up again, Sally felt heavy. The man fell asleep on top of her. She tried changing position
              and wiggled, but the man woke up and fucked her again. That happened one more time a few hours later; she
              learned a lesson “I am his property to fuck as he pleases”. She smiled wickedly at that idea, wrapped her
              hands around his neck and fell asleep.
